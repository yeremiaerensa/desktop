  // Place your snippets for json here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "ts_nodemon": {
    "prefix": "ts_nodemon",
    "body": [
      "\"nodemon --watch src --ext ts --exec \\\"node --loader ts-node/esm\\\" src/index.ts\""
    ],
    "description": "Run TypeScript using nodemon with ts-node in ESM mode"
  }
